# Vaybertaytsh Episode: Yiddish and Jesus #

## Rukhl Slutsky and Mindl Cohen ##

(Mindl introduces herself and our project)

**Rukhl (introduces  herself):** Hello. My  name is Rukhl  Slutsky and
I'm a doctoral student at the  Harvard Yiddish Studies program. One of
my interests  is the Jewish standpoint  on Jesus.  How has  the Jewish
standpoint  on Jesus  developed over  the  years? Is  there a  single,
consistent standpoint  at all? What  were the Jews' thoughts  on Jesus
throughout  our history?   Has his  figure been  somewhat negative,  a
symbol of Jewish suffering at the hands of Christians? Or, has he been
though  of as  just  another  Jew, whom  a  couple  of people  started
regarding as God?  Who was Jesus  according to Jews of various epochs?
Let us begin by talking a bit about Jesus from the Jewish perspective.

**Rukhl:** Mindl,  what have you  learnt about  Jesus at home?  Was he
regarded as the Messiah, or just  a rabbi, or maybe a completely fake,
non-historical figure?

**Mindl:** Rukhl, I was taught that he  was a rabbi, just a rabbi like
others. Perhaps  also, that  he was  a kind of  radical, who  had some
unorthodox ideas. Even a bit crazy, but, in any case, a Jew.

**Rukhl:** I've also heard similar things. But now I'm researching the
whole story from a Jewish  viewpoint regarding Jesus. Our question is:
have Jews  from all  historical periods understood  Jesus in  the same
light as we do today - as a rabbi, as a Jew?

Let me take you  to a time when everything was  different. The time is
the  Middle Ages  and  the place:  Europe. A  new  book has  appeared,
written by a Jew, titled "The History  of Jesus". At first it was only
available in Aramaic, then in Hebrew,  later also in Yiddish and other
more contemporary  languages. This  book was tremendously  popular. It
was a parody of The New Testament.

In  the book  Jesus was  presented as  a total  scoundrel.  He  is not
respectable and  certainly not a  Messiah.  On  the contrary, he  is a
bastard,  both according  to  the Jewish  Law  (Halakha) and  speaking
figuratively.   His mother,  Miriam  or Mary,  is  a prostitute,  made
pregnant by a Roman soldier. Other  versions argue that his father was
a Jewish man  by the name of  "Joseph Pandera" (this is  also what the
Talmud claims).  This  is another example of what the  book strives to
accomplish  - to  discredit the  authenticity of  Jesus.  The  book is
strongly anti-Christian, that is not against the Christian people, but
against  Jesus himself.   From this,  however,  we see  that Jesus  is
equated  to   antisemitism,  its   prime  motive.    And  consequently
Christianity is, in general, regarded as an antisemitic religion.

**Mindl:** Rukhl,  is this something  that can  only be found  in "The
History of Jesus", or does it also appear in other texts?

**Rukhl:** That's a good question. Looking at the words and vocabulary
of the time we  can see that Jews have continued to  think of Jesus as
different  and to  mock him.  For example,  "some say"  that the  name
"Jesus" is  an acronym for "blame  his name and remember",  which is a
very grave  Hebrew curse to say  to anyone. Jews have  had other names
for Jesus, such as "Ishka". Putting  the letter "ק" (kuf, qoph) in the
middle of  a name served,  most of the  time, to protect  oneself from
saying  a holy  name, such  as "אלוקים"  (elokim) instead  of "אלוהים"
(elohim). But  in the case  of Jesus this is  thought to have  had two
possible explanations: either it was a joke - as if he were "god", or,
if we don't  want to say an  evil name, whereby the "ק"  in the middle
helps.

We  have  another  word,  an  expression  actually:  "not  risen,  not
followed" when something  is impossible - roughly  equivalent to "when
hell freezes over". This proverb is  not about Jesus but about what he
has done  in the  New Testament.  Literally it is  taken to  mean that
Jesus is  neither God nor miracle  worker. He has not  walked (neither
the heaven, nor the sea) and he has not risen from the dead.

**Mindl:** Why then,  with all the expressions and  parodies of Jesus,
was it all so popular among the Jews?

**Rukhl:**
