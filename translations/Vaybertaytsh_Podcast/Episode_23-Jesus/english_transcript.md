# Vaybertaytsh Episode: Yiddish and Jesus #

## Rukhl Slutsky and Mindl Cohen ##

(Mindl introduces herself and our project)

Rukhl (introduces herself): Hello. My name  is Rukhl Slutsky and I'm a
doctoral student  at the  Harvard Yiddish Studies  program. One  of my
interests  is the  Jewish  standpoint  on Jesus.  How  has the  Jewish
standpoint  on Jesus  developed over  the  years? Is  there a  single,
consistent standpoint  at all? What  were the Jews' thoughts  on Jesus
throughout  our history?  Has  his figure  been  somewhat negative,  a
symbol of Jewish suffering at the hands of Christians? Or, has he been
though  of as  just  another  Jew, whom  a  couple  of people  started
regarding as God?  Who was Jesus according to Jews  of various epochs?
Let us begin by talking a bit about Jesus from the Jewish perspective.

Rukhl:  Mindl, what  have  you  learnt about  Jesus  at  home? Was  he
regarded as the Messiah, or just  a rabbi, or maybe a completely fake,
non-historical figure?

Mindl: Rukhl,  I was  taught that he  was a rabbi,  just a  rabbi like
others. Perhaps  also, that  he was  a kind of  radical, who  had some
unorthodox ideas. Even a bit crazy, but, in any case, a Jew.
